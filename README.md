# Pseudo random number generators

Repository contains implementations of number generators from different distributions. All of them are based on modular arithmetic.

### Out directory - results from individual generators
- values of chi-square statistic
- degrees of freedom
- numbers from specific distribution

### Plots directory 
- probability distribution plots from individual generators
